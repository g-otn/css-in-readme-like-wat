I wanted to test the GitHub feature which allows you to display a README on your profile
page, and well as a trick that enables you to [put HTML and CSS in README files](https://github.com/sindresorhus/css-in-readme-like-wat).

Thanks to [ioxua](https://github.com/ioxua) for showing me this fun trick and also
motivating me to mess a little with it.
