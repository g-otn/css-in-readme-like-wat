This is a repository that contains some fun I had messing with CSS for no purpose.

I wanted to test the GitHub feature that allows to put a README.md on your profile
page, and also a trick that allows you to [put CSS in README files](https://github.com/sindresorhus/css-in-readme-like-wat).

Thanks [ioxua](https://github.com/ioxua) for showing me this fun trick and also
motivating me to mess a little with it.
